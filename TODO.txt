TODO : 
- Retrain the model using the summarize description ?
- Try to train a gpt-neo 2.7B using deepspeed  : take a look at this https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.26.1/en/main_classes/deepspeed
- Generate like 50 poster using the title and use clip to check which image correspond the most to description given ?
- Deploy using gradio and AWS

DONE :
- Generate the dataset :
    it form would be a csv with two columns <movie name> & <synopsis>
    How to generate the data ? 
        1. Find it online on kaggle or hugginface
        2. Webscrapping a website (allocine or wikipedia)

    Using this format the dataset will already be on the good format for GPT finetuning which is <prompt> <completion>
- Give description by summarizing the plot and then feed it to LLM model !
- Train the model 


ERROR TO FIX :
