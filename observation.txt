Observation for myself as the projet goes on


- Language choice : As GPT was trained on engligh dataset, the finetuning would be better on english Language
    -> Language = engligh

- Wikipedia : 
    Format : Section title are <Title name> | 

- To use the Wikipedia dataset we need a list of movie 

- How to train the model, can we use the Trainer ? or should we do our won trainer class




- data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False) cannot be used the data is not in the right format for it find why
Find the good way to use this data_collator without issue
